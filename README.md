## Problem Statement and Motivation

The Idea behind our Project is the requirement of various day to day tasks related to a PDF file in a professional world. These tasks might include Compressing PDF, Merging 2 PDFs, Splitting PDFs, PDF to Word conversion, and so on. So we will basically try to inculcate these functionalities all at one place, just to make things handy.


The Motivation for the project is the need of these tools regularly, especially being a student. So instead of going from one site to another to perform these tasks, our main aim throughout the project will be just to make a website which will have all these functionalities and user will be able to access them all at one place. Also, various websites charges for such tasks to be done or adds watermark sort of things. Our project will help them to do all these things without any such charges or watermarks.
